# Reverse-Engineer-Technics-Remover-simple

Some simple instructions reverted from some workout crackmes that can detect an anti-dump from a PE binary file, and also detect if it is being debugged.

## Use

Use this to look for protections in your debugs, good luck, See also that it can be added in your applications for own protections.

```bash
asm ant-dump.asm
asm ant-restart.asm
```
